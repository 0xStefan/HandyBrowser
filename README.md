### How HandyBrowser Works

HandyBrowser is using node-webkit [nw.js](https://nwjs.io) under the hood. Nw.js packages the latest chromium with the latest node.js and allows us granular security, html and many other features. 
Since we did not want users to manually have to modify system level configurations and run HNSD/HNS resolvers locally themselves, we rely on Docker. 
Docker allows us to create a lightweight linux virtual machine that installs HNS resolvers, and is pre-configured to use the HNS resolver. We simply proxy all web traffic from the chromium browser into the Docker machine which resolves via HSD and returns content! Docker generates a self-signed certificate on container creation which allows the user to proxy https traffic to the browser. **During installation Docker runs a one-time install process, after that it won't need to be run again, and you'll be able to start browsing/resolving names immediately (even as the HSD fullnodes syncs in Docker).**

Why Nw.js over Electron? The lead-dev of this project has used Nw.js extensively in enterprise-class application for many years and knows the inside/outs of every piece of the framework. In addition, the window manager (urlbar) we wrote needed to control all windows (tabs) created within the application and IPC is not fun. Nw.js allowed us more flexibility for the task of building a web-browser while offering the security we needed: No browser windows have access to Node.js, just the window manager.

### HandyBrowser TODOs

0. Make Windows Resize/move work properly. Currently the window.move and window.resize events for Windows result in subpixel walks across the screen. Likely need an elegant way to do this.

1. Re-enable HNSD when it's production ready. We got HNSD to work and the dockerfile is there to build. Setting ```this.resolver = 'hsd'; //|| hnsd``` to 'hnsd' in file ```js/boot.js:24``` will allow you to boot with hnsd. Why not HNSD? We had issues with queueing and timeouts at scale. It works great for one site at a time. However when opening multiple tabs with tons of analytics happening (google.com, ebay.com, facebook.com, yahoo.com) HNSD would have a request that would lag and cause subsequent requests to wait for a timeout to happen. Replicating can be done by modifying ```/etc/resolv.conf``` to use ```8.8.8.8``` instead of ```127.0.0.1``` and see the difference. Thus we use hsd for now [PRs welcome if you can get it working].

2. It would be great to not need Docker's overhead. If there were a way to tell the browser which DNS to use locally that would be ideal. We're going work with the community and see if there's a more elegant solution in time.

3. Re-enable the HandyMiner GUI that's built in already. Shell script/workflow to install hstratum onto the dockerized HSD machine needs to be made.

4. Figure out how to get Chrome extensions working. They are most certainly supported in nw.js.

### HandyBrowser Install FAQS

  - Before running HandyBrowser the first time, make sure you have Docker installed and running [Note you don't need a Docker account, simply just the Docker service so we can install the dependencies for your Handshake node]:

MacOS - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/

Windows - https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/

Linux - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

  - Your firewall may prompt you a couple of times for permissions the first time you run the browser, be sure to accept those. We need them to make the browser work.
  - If you have any trouble with your Docker node not loading, enter these commands in your terminal, and run the browser once more:
  ```sh
$ Docker stop HandyBrowserHSD
$ Docker rm HandyBrowserHSD
$ Docker image rm handybrowser
```
